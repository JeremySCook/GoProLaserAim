# GoPro Laser Aiming Fixture

![](https://github.com/JeremySCook/GoProLaserAim/blob/master/logo-template-laserAim.jpg)

3D-Printed device for aiming a GoPro camera. Wiring, assembly, and [how it's used is shown off in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc0DtLFc5Wk), but it's just an on/off switch.

Parts needed:

<ul>
	<li>3D printed body included
	<li>laser https://amzn.to/2Yya9Xp (Amazon: 40-pack, didn't reallize just how cheap they are!)
	<li>button https://amzn.to/2YBax7C (Amazon: I think that's the right model)
	<li>battery https://www.adafruit.com/product/1570 or https://amzn.to/2Yz7jRS (Amazon)
	<li>JST connectors https://amzn.to/2VMVtqo (Amazon)
	<li>wires</li>
</ul>

Note that I've applied for a provisional utility patent on this device, so while you're welcome to make one for yourself, please get in contact if you'd like to manufacture in bulk via info@jeremyscook.com. I'd love to discuss licensing the idea!
