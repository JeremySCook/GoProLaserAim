# GoPro Laser Aiming Fixture

![](https://github.com/JeremySCook/GoProLaserAim/blob/master/logo-template-laserAim.jpg)

3D-Printed device for aiming a GoPro camera. Wiring and assembly per to-be-released video, but it's just an on/off switch.

Parts needed:

<ul>
	<li>3D printed body included
	<li>laser https://amzn.to/2Yya9Xp (Amazon affiliate: 40-pack, didn't reallize just how cheap they are!)
	<li>button

	<li>JST connectors https://amzn.to/2VMVtqo (Amazon affiliate)

</ul>

Note that I've applied for a provisional utility patent on this device, so while you're welcome to make one for yourself, please get in contact if you'd like to manufacture in bulk via info@jeremyscook.com. I'd love to discuss licensing the idea!
